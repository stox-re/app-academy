// User Experience and User Interface

// Feeling that a user gets from using a product
// Interface is the layer between the user and the product

// Pretty design != Good UX

/*

  Take advantage of convention
  Create effective visual hierarchies
  Eliminate distractions

  Quality of clicks is more important than quantity
  Wher quality = less thought needed
  Have low expectations of your users

*/

// Principles of User Experience Design

/*
  Keep it simple
  Guide users towards doing what you want
  Everything should be where you expect
  Everything should do what you expect
  User test, user test, user test to ensure the above points
*/

// User Testing

/*
  Testing is the only way to know if your site has good UX
  Test your full stack project
  Sit friends and family down and ask them to use your site
  Watch where they get confused, ask them about their experience
  - Don't try to guide
*/

// Designing to look good
/*
  Add margin and padding
  Make sure headings are close to the text that follows them

  Please use a grid, no grid = unpolished site
  Use a grid pattern when creating your wireframes.

  Have a text hierarchy, use h1, h2, h3

  Colors 2-4 colours
  - Sets the feel of the site
  - Use a constrained pallete

  Better forms
  - One column
  Checkboxes/radio buttons also in one column
  Specify errors inline
  Have the least input fields as possible

  Images
  Don't host them yourself, use a CDN like cloudinary
  unsplash - free high res images

  Logo
  - Use a logo descriptive - and a tagline
  - trello homepage is a good example

  Accessibility
  - Alt text for images
  - Use headings correctly
  - Semantic tags and labels are hugely important for screen readers
  - Don't have flashing stuff

  - Always create significant contrast
  - Comic Sans is useful
